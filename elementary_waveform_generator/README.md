An elementary waveform generator implemented using 3 different Look-Up Tables (LUTs).

The left-most 3 switches correspond to 3 different waveforms:

1) Maximum Amplitude Sine Wave
2) Half Max. Amplitude Sine Wave
3) Max Amplitude Triangle Wave

The data can be transmitted using the right-most switch and integrated with the MATLAB plotting code to visualize the generated digital waves.

Additionally, one can also connect the outputs to a Digital-Analog Converter for visualization on an oscilloscope.
