These directories contain codes to transmit data converted by the XADC analog-digital converter to MATLAB for real-time plotting. 

1) XADC_MATLAB - Transmit data from ONE channel on the XADC, namely Channel 6.

2) xadc_transmit_channels - Access to all channels on the XADC, based upon on-board switch configuration, to transmit data to MATLAB.
